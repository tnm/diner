diner
=====

**counting and ranking service with redis in ruby**

overview
--------

diner provides a simple API to a specific subset of Redis actions, namely:

* incrementing a sorted set's element
* returning the cardinality of a sorted set
* returning the rank of a sorted set's element
* returning the score of a sorted set's element

With these actions, diner can be used as a *counter and ranking service over HTTP*. diner speaks JSON, 
but it'd be trivial to add XML support.

diner is built on Sinatra, so it can be started locally with Sinatra on localhost and port 4567. 
diner's tests run against a local running instance of Redis; the tests will create a few test keys.

api
-----

All interaction with diner occurs at the key resource level, accessed via either GET or POST at `/:key`. 

Using the key `foo` as an example:

** Increment an element ** 
    POST /foo
with parameters: `command=increment, element=bigelement, score=20.0`

** Get the cardinality of a sorted set **

    GET /foo?command=card'

** Get the rank of an element of a sorted set **

    GET /foo?command=rank&element=bar

** Get the score of an element of a sorted set **
    
    GET /foo?command=score&element=bar
